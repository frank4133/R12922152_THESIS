# ASUS-MEF
Multi-exposure Fusion for Dynamic Scenes
# Usage

### Environment
Python 3.11
```shell
# create conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml

# the default env name is ASUS-MEF
conda activate ASUS-MEF
```

### Training
You can change the config in [start_train.py](./start_train.py)
```
python start_train.py
```
### Testing
To avoid OOM errors and dimension mismatches during concatenation, we resize the input to a multiple of 512 Ã— 384, and then resize the output back.
The default input size is 3072 x 2048, which is controlled by the variable `scale`.
